## 😽Gratitude
I'm a newbie programmer, and this is my first complete project, so there are still many things need to be fixed and optimized.\
I'm trying my best to improve my progamming skills day by day, and create much better projects afterward.\
Thanks for your attention. If you like this cute small game, hope you can help me improve it, or give me a star so that I have more motivation to innovate the game.
