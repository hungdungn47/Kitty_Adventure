# Kitty's adventure
## Overview
This is a small 2D game in which you become a cute `kitty`. \
The idea of the game is very simple. \
Your mission is to run and pass the obstacles as fast as possible so that the kitty stays on the screen, until it reaches the end of the map.
## Language used
This game is made with `C++` and `SDL2` graphics library. \
## How to install
I have included all the necessary files in the project. So you only have to: 
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `main.exe`.

Now enjoy the game !!!
## How to play
This is a one-button game. Press the `space bar` to reverse the direction of gravity, so that the kitty falls in opposite direction.
